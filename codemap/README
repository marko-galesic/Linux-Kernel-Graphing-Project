README for the revised Free Code Graphing Project  -*- text -*- 

To render the tiles for php kernel map execute the following commands:

$ mkdir tiles
$ cd bin
$ gcc split-image.c -o split-image -lpng
$ PATH=$PWD:$PATH
$ maketiles fullposter.ps ../tiles

fullposter.ps should be a postscript file containing your kernel poster,
for example, one that you created by running posterize letter 1 previously.

Copy the tiles and web directory to a webserver with php,
you will have to modify the php source to fit your site.  Most importantly
edit the reference in map.php to the tiles directory to point to your new tiles
directory.
